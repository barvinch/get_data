Original data description (quoted information was taken from original data description)
"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone 
(Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows 
of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter 
into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. "

"Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) 
using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm 
(tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing 
fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 
(Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag"

Only following variables were taken according to course project task:
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
meanFreq() were excluded because this variable is about frequency.

"Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean"

Features were normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
Each feature vector is a row on the original data text file.

Task was set as
"create R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

  1  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject."
  
  On step 4 names "Activity" and "subject" were given to themselves.
  In order to have no duplicate variable names, names were changed, so dots are used instead of spaces, '-', '(' and ')'.
  For example "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" became  "tBodyAcc.mean...X".
  
  Final data set have following columns:
